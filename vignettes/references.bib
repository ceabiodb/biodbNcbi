For the past 11 years, PubChem has grown to a sizable system, serving as a chemical information resource for the scientific research community. PubChem consists of three inter-linked databases, Substance, Compound and BioAssay. The Substance database contains chemical information deposited by individual data contributors to PubChem, and the Compound database stores unique chemical structures extracted from the Substance database. Biological activity data of chemical substances tested in assay experiments are contained in the BioAssay database. This paper provides an overview of the PubChem Substance and Compound databases, including data sources and contents, data organization, data submission using PubChem Upload, chemical structure standardization, web-based interfaces for textual and non-textual searches, and programmatic access. It also gives a brief description of PubChem3D, a resource derived from theoretical three-dimensional structures of compounds in PubChem, as well as PubChemRDF, Resource Description Framework (RDF)-formatted PubChem data for data sharing, analysis and integration with information contained in other databases.}",

    abstract = "{The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) collaboration involves curators at multiple centers with a goal of producing a conservative set of high quality, protein-coding region annotations for the human and mouse reference genome assemblies. The CCDS data set reflects a ‘gold standard’ definition of best supported protein annotations, and corresponding genes, which pass a standard series of quality assurance checks and are supported by manual curation. This data set supports use of genome annotation information by human and mouse researchers for effective experimental design, analysis and interpretation. The CCDS project consists of analysis of automated whole-genome annotation builds to identify identical CDS annotations, quality assurance testing and manual curation support. Identical CDS annotations are tracked with a CCDS identifier (ID) and any future change to the annotated CDS structure must be agreed upon by the collaborating members. CCDS curation guidelines were developed to address some aspects of curation in order to improve initial annotation consistency and to reduce time spent in discussing proposed annotation updates. Here, we present the current status of the CCDS database and details on our procedures to track and coordinate our efforts. We also present the relevant background and reasoning behind the curation standards that we have developed for CCDS database treatment of transcripts that are nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) candidates, for transcripts containing upstream open reading frames, for identifying the most likely translation start codons and for the annotation of readthrough transcripts. Examples are provided to illustrate the application of these guidelines.Database URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi}",

abstract="Effective use of the human and mouse genomes requires reliable identification of  genes and their products. Although multiple public resources provide annotation,  different methods are used that can result in similar but not identical  representation of genes, transcripts, and proteins. The collaborative consensus  coding sequence (CCDS) project tracks identical protein annotations on the reference  mouse and human genomes with a stable identifier (CCDS ID), and ensures that they  are consistently represented on the NCBI, Ensembl, and UCSC Genome Browsers.  Importantly, the project coordinates on manually reviewing inconsistent protein  annotations between sites, as well as annotations for which new evidence suggests a  revision is needed, to progressively converge on a complete protein-coding set for  the human and mouse reference genomes, while maintaining a high standard of  reliability and biological accuracy. To date, the project has identified 20,159  human and 17,707 mouse consensus coding regions from 17,052 human and 16,893 mouse  genes. Three evaluation methods indicate that the entries in the CCDS set are highly  likely to represent real proteins, more so than annotations from contributing groups  not included in CCDS. The CCDS database thus centralizes the function of identifying  well-supported, identically-annotated, protein-coding regions.",
